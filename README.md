# FinSets

Hello, here I try different formalizations of finite sets in Lean.

So far I use these approaches.

In Kuratowski.lean I try to implement finite sets based on Kuratowski sets as described in here http://cs.ru.nl/~nweide/FiniteSetsInHoTT.pdf, where this is done in Coq.

In RedBlackTree.lean I try to implement finite sets based on red black trees inspired by https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/redblack.pdf and https://lean-forward.github.io/pubs/konovalova_bsc_thesis.pdf.

Many thanks to all authors that previously developed finite set formalizations.
