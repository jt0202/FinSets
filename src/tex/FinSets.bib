@article{Constructive,
   abstract = {Abstract. This articles plays with several properties of Bishop sets which would be equivalent in ZFC to being finite. One of which is new. We take this oportunity to closely consider the different properties of finite sets and how they (constructively) relate to one another. We close this article by presenting a few well-known algorithms on finite structures, and describe which kind of finiteness they require.},

abstract="In this chapter we are concerned with a basic theme of combinatorics: properties and sizes of special families {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}{\$}of subsets of a finite set N = {\{}1, 2, . . . , n{\}}. We start with two results which are classics in the field: the theorems of Sperner and of Erd{\H{o}}s--Ko--Rado. These two results have in common that they were reproved many times and that each of them initiated a new field of combinatorial set theory. For both theorems, induction seems to be the natural method, but the arguments we are going to discuss are quite different and truly inspired.",
